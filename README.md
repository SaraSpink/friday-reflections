###### Hello World!
Coding bootcamp has been a challenging journey for me. I came in feeling enthusiastic about code. Every time something rendered correctly in a browser or accepted user input I felt a wave of excitement. I made that! I defined a variable! IT WORKS AND I UNDERSTAND WHY! It's a wonderful feeling I hope most of us have had a chance to experience at the start of our coding journey.

About two months into Epicodus's full-time web development bootcamp (Ruby/JavaScript/Rails) I crashed _hard_ into a wall of self-doubt and existential anxiety.

_Rationally I know that:_
- Not being at the same level as the top students in my class does not mean I will never get a job
- If I do not fully understand a concept today I will eventually understand it with continued study (learning is actually fun, after all!)
- Learning something new does not mean I have given up on my previous career and the creative work I have done up to this point.
. When I reflect on my experience thusfar
#### areas I want to improve:
- Coding syntax
- Confidence
- Ability to articulate myself about specific concepts

#### priorities:
- Clarify my direction
- I want to learn:
  - react
  - sass
  - python
